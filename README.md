# DDDASaveToolSharp
 The C# version of FluffyQuack's DDDASaveTool!
 
 I converted the C++ code into C# as I'm a sharp guy (hah get it?) and having to rely solely on the tool itself was a pain, so I decided to convert the code into C# simplyfying the process by a ton, and should help fellow sharp developers modify and repack their save file easily.

 I included some basic player/pawn altering so you can easily modify their stats, appearance etc.
